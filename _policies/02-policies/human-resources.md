## Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to establish the requirements for establishing comprehensive human resources processes to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Welkin information and resources during all phases of a workforce member or contractor's association with Welkin.

## Scope

This policy covers all Welkin workforce member and contractor transition phases, including pre-hiring, transfers and separation.

## Pre-Employment

## Background Screening

Legal Team must perform criminal and employment background screening on all prospective workforce members, and any contractors that require access to Sensitive/Regulated information. In case of contractors, screening requirements may be superseded by the contract between Welkin and the contracting firm.

The background screening process is initiated by the Legal Team after a candidate has accepted an offer. A new hire may only start with Welkin once the criminal background screening has been completed by the candidate, and subsequently cleared by Legal Team. Disqualifying criminal offenses will be escalated to the Welkin executive team to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Exceptions to disqualifying offenses must be approved by the Welkin CEO. In the event the background check does not pass requirements and no exception is granted, Legal Team will notify the hiring manager and rescind the offer.

## Onboarding

###  Non-Disclosure Agreements
Welkin workforce members and contractors are required to execute non-disclosure agreements reflecting Welkin's needs for the protection of data and operational details. Legal Team is responsible for drafting and reviewing such agreements as necessary.

### Access Control Onboarding
Access to Welkin information systems for all new hires and contractors must be configured commensurate with the workforce member's roles and responsibilities and the principle of least privilege. Any exceptions to this requirement must be specifically approved by Legal Team and Security Team. Access requests shall be made with a completed Access Request Ticket.

### Asset Security
All physical asset allocation to all workforce members and contractors must be documented and tracked. Workforce members and contractors are responsible for ensuring the safety and security of physical assets issued to them, such as laptops and phones. All mobile devices must be configured and maintained according to the Welkin Mobile Device Security Policy.

## Employment

### Privacy & Security Awareness Training

All Welkin workforce members are required to take annual privacy and security awareness training. Workforce members must re-acknowledge understanding of Welkin policies at least annually. If a workforce member is found in violation of a policy or undertakes an action that demonstrates lack of security awareness, that workforce member may be required to retrain.

### Investigation

All Welkin workforce members and contractors are required to report suspected or actual violations of Welkin information privacy and security policies, procedures, and standards, to the Welkin Security Officer immediately.

### Performance Review

All Welkin workforce members are evaluated on their job performance anually according to a structure dicated by management.


##  Separation

###  Separation Communication
All workforce member terminations must be coordinated with Legal Team upon receipt of resignation and prior to the actual date of separation. Contractor terminations must be coordinated with Legal Team if the contract is ending early.

###  Access Revocation
All workforce member and contractor access (both physical and logical) to Welkin premises, information and resources must be terminated effective the date of termination. Shared credentials must be rotated.

### Asset Returns

All Welkin-owned physical assets must be returned within 24 hours of termination. If access to the asset(s) is being requested by the manager/department, proper asset transfer procedures must be followed and any such transfers must be documented.
