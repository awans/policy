title: Acceptable Use
---


## Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to specify acceptable usage of information, systems and facilities by all Welkin workforce members and contractors. Acceptable use requirements are designed for safeguarding sensitive Welkin information assets, including customer data.


## Scope

This policy covers all information created, received, transmitted, or maintained by or on behalf of Welkin. This policy also covers all information and systems in Welkin's environments, including any personal devices interfacing with Welkin systems.


## Policy

Welkin assets are intended for business purposes only. Specific use of each is defined by each workforce member or contractor's primary job function. If an activity is not part of a workforce member or contractor's primary function, he/she must obtain a formal approval from management before proceeding with the activity. Assets such as mobile devices must be monitored while in use and be reconcilable to the associated user(s) by Welkin Security.

Incidental personal use may be permissible if the use does not consume more than a trivial amount of resources that could otherwise be used for business purposes, does not interfere with worker productivity, and does not preempt any business activity. Users are responsible for exercising good judgment regarding appropriate personal use of Welkin resources such that it does not negatively impact Welkin in any way. If there is any confusion or uncertainty, users should consult their manager or supervisor.


### Acceptable Use of Information Assets

Welkin workforce members and contractors must use information assets provided by the company in accordance with Welkin policies, standards and procedures.


#### Approved Uses

Information assets provided by Welkin, both internally (networks, servers, databases, services such as the Internet and e-mail, etc.) or externally (such as remote access) are the sole property of Welkin and are intended for the company business use only.

*   All information assets must be used for their intended or authorized purposes only;
*   Any use for unintended or unauthorized purposes requires the advance approval of the Welkin Security Officer and Welkin Security;
*   All mobile information assets are required to be secured pursuant to the Welkin Mobile Security policy;
*   Access to information assets and critical processes must be authenticated with user ID and password or other authentication item (for example, token);
*   Personal use of the Welkin information assets is authorized as follows:
    *   All personal use must comply with relevant Welkin policies, standards, and procedures and applicable federal, state, and local laws;
    *   Personal use must be during non-working hours and must consume only a trivial amount of processing power, storage space or network bandwidth. Personal use is at the discretion of management and may be denied or terminated without reason or notice;
    *   Files and data that are personal in nature and stored in Welkin information assets are considered the property of Welkin and may be deleted without notice and without a right to recovery by the user. Specific examples of this could include music or image files stored on a network drive, where the administrator of the drive needs to recover disk space for business purposes and removes any file types that are not business related;
    *   Welkin networks are for the use of approved, Welkin-owned computing assets only. Personal devices are not permitted unless they have been approved by Welkin Security.

*   The transmission of information with the intent to damage Welkin's reputation;

*   Writing, modifying or distributing computer viruses, Trojan horses, worms or any other form of malicious software;
*   Taking any action for malicious purposes, or in any manner negatively impacting the interests of the company;
