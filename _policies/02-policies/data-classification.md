title: Data Classification
---

## Puprpose

The purpose of this policy is to specify a data classification framework to assist data owners in the determination of security requirements for data/information assets. Consistent classification is essential for safeguarding both Welkin, and customer/partner data, information and documents.

## Scope

This policy applies to all documents created or modified after the adoption date of this policy. All existing documents will retain their existing classification. When these documents are reviewed, modified or processed, they should be reclassified per the new Data Classification Policy. For all electronic data or documents, the system timestamp on the documents should be used to identify when the document or data was last updated.

## Classification Levels

All data, information or documents created, stored or processed by Welkin should be appropriately classified into one of the classification levels described below. All data, information or documents must be maintained per the security requirements for the classification level from the time such data/information/document is created until it is destroyed or reclassified. Destruction of data should follow the Data Retention and Disposal Policy. If the user is unsure of the classification level of the artifact, the user shall treat the artifact as if it was classified at the highest level (Sensitive/Regulated). All artifacts are to be classified at the highest classification requirement of any individual data elements within the artifact. All non-public documents should either be subject to access controls (such as requiring a Google Drive login, for example) or should be marked with appropriate classification level.

### Sensitive/Regulated

Any information protected by federal, state or local laws and regulations or industry standards, such as HIPAA/HITECH, state data protection laws, and PCI-DSS. Examples of this information include, but are not limited to:

*   Personally Identifiable Information (PII): Any information about an individual that:
    *   Can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as name, date and place of birth, mother's maiden name or biometric records;
    *   Is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial and employment information, which if lost, compromised or disclosed without authorization, could result in harm to that individual; and
    *   Is protected by federal, state or local laws and regulation or industry standards.
*   Protected Health Information (PHI): Any information created, received, maintained, processed or transmitted by Welkin that relates to the past, present or future physical or mental health or condition of an individual, the provision of health care to an individual or the past, present or future payment for health care and:
    *   Identifies the individual; or
    *   With respect to which there is a reasonable basis to believe that the information can be used to identify the individual.

Welkin Legal is responsible for determining whether particular information created, received, maintained, processed or transmitted by Welkin constitutes Sensitive/Regulated information.


### Restricted

Restricted refers to internal information which is sensitive in nature and restricted in its use and distribution. Access to this information should be limited to only authorized Welkin users on a need-to-know basis. The exposure of this information could reduce Welkin's competitive advantage, cause significant damage to Welkin's interests, or expose Welkin to legal consequences. This information may be regulated by contractual agreements (e.g. NDA provisions) or other legal or regulatory requirements. Examples of this information include, but are not limited to:



*   Private information such as contracts, employee personal information, sensitive business partner information, business proposals, strategies, marketing plans, market conditions data, financial data or processes, source code, technical data, security metrics and reports, audit reports, formulae, programs, processes, etc.;
*   Customer lists, contact information, or sensitive customer data;
*   Information from and concerning vendors, including (but not limited to) vendor pricing lists and sales agreements, unless prior written approval has been given by the vendor; and
*   Information from and concerning any third party (including but not limited to customers) with which Welkin does business, unless prior written approval has been given by the third party.


### Confidential

Confidential refers to information for use or distribution internally within Welkin. Confidential information is intended for the use of employees (or, in appropriate instances, business partners) when conducting Company business. This includes (but is not limited to):


*   Operational business information and reports;
*   Information which is created or discovered by or on behalf of Welkin, scheduled for development, or currently under development;
*   Information known by or conveyed to Welkin which may have commercial value in Welkin's business;
*   Information which is typically handled in the normal course of company business, including (but not limited to) interoffice memos and communication, corporate policies and standards, contact directories, organizational charts, and other similar information.


### Public

Public information does not have confidentiality requirements and can be shared with external parties. However, public information has high integrity requirements and information should thus be properly vetted by appropriate members of Welkin leadership prior to exposure to the public. Examples include:

*   Press releases
*   Advertising;
*   Reports intended for public distribution;
*   Information posted to Welkin's Internet-facing public web sites.


## Roles and Responsibilities


### Data Owners

As specified in the Welkin Data Retention and Disposal policy, all Welkin information system components must have an assigned owner. Data owners are responsible for:

*   Knowing and understanding the nature of the data in their assigned components;
*   Establishing an accurate classification level for that data; and
*   Defining security requirements and special handling procedures for that data.


### Data Custodians

Data custodians are responsible for maintaining data and systems that process it. Data custodians typically include system administrators, database administrators, infrastructure team members, human resources personnel, finance team members, and corporate security personnel. Data custodians are responsible for maintaining their data and systems according to the confidentiality, integrity and availability requirements specified by the classification level.


### Data Users

Data users are responsible for properly using and handling the data during the normal course of business operations. Data users should exercise due care in handling data so as to not violate the requirements specified by the assigned classification level.
