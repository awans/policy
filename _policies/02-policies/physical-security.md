title: Physical Security

## Purpose
This Physical Security Procedure governs how Welkin controls access to its office workspace, and ensures the security of our data and infrastructure with respect to physical threat.

## Scope

This policy applies to any physical location Welkin Health has offices.


## Datacenter Security

As a matter of policy, the Welkin office is an unprivileged location. Welkin's office is not where the hosting infrastructure that powers its cloud services is located, and it has no special access to our datacenter.

Welkin makes use of Amazon Web Services' cloud infrastructure services. We have a BAA in place with Amazon. Because of this, Welkin does not control facility access procedures for the data centers that house our customers' patient data.

Amazon is a world-class provider of secure hosting services with a long track record of successfully preventing unauthorized access to their facilities. In the terms of our BAA with them, they guarantee that they will maintain all needed security measures to prevent such unauthorized access from occurring. For more information on AWS Datacenter Physical Security, see the [AWS Security Whitepaper](https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/aws-security-whitepaper.pdf), or [http://aws.amazon.com/security/](http://aws.amazon.com/security/).


## Office Security

While the Welkin office has no privileged access to our datacenter, ensuring strong physical security is nonetheless important as a matter of defense in depth.

Access to the Welkin office is protected by two doors with key card entrances, one outer door for the building and an inner door at both the elevator and side stairs. The outer door always requires a key card or for our office manager to admit the person via the entry system. The inner doors always require a key card. Only current Welkin employees have key cards.

If a Welkin employee is closing the office, they are required to close all windows, lock all doors, and ensure nobody else is present before leaving.

There are cameras in all non-public parts of our building, and employee workstations face away from public parts of the office. Additionally, employees are required to have automatic screen locks and passwords on all workstations in the office.


## Visitors and Guests

Visitors must sign in to the office and sign out when they leave. Visitors must provide government issued identification. Guests of Welkin are required to have an employee to be present to allow entrance. Under no circumstances will a non-employee be left unsupervised in the Welkin office.
