title: Data Retention and Disposal
---

## Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to establish the requirements for data retention duration and eventual disposal in order to ensure confidentiality of sensitive Welkin information assets and customer data.

## Scope

This policy applies to all documents created or modified after the adoption date of this policy.

## Data Ownership

All Welkin information system components must have an assigned owner, which may be either an individual or a team. Additional responsibilities for data owners and other stakeholders are specified in the Data Classification Policy.


## Data Retention

Each Welkin data owner must establish data retention schedules for information assets owned by the unit. Retention schedules must adhere to any compliance, regulatory, contractual, and organizational requirements. Retention schedules must be made available to all users with a need-to-know.

Data custodians (as defined in the Data Classification Policy) must ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data and related information assets until their proper disposal after the retention period has expired.


## Cardholder Data

Welkin does not collect payment cardholder data. Customers are responsible for not transmitting payment card or cardholder data to Welkin. If, during the normal course of provisioning the Welkin services, or during an audit, payment cardholder data is found, Welkin workforce members must report it to the Welkin Security Officer.


## Data Disposal

Each Welkin data owner must establish data disposal procedures. The disposal procedures must be consistent with the data's retention schedule. Disposal procedures must also ensure that all information assets classified as Sensitive/Regulated, Restricted, or Confidential pursuant to the Welkin Data Classification Policy are disposed of in a secure manner. When in doubt, information should be considered Sensitive/Regulated for disposal purposes.

Each business unit must ensure that disposal methods adhere to any compliance, regulatory, contractual, and organizational requirements and they must also maintain accurate records of all disposal activities.

Data disposal schedules and procedures are maintained in the Welkin Security Handbook.

Physical materials awaiting disposal, regardless of form or media (disks, hardcopy, etc.), must be secured so they cannot be accessed by unauthorized individuals.


## E-Discovery Exception

Welkin must suspend disposal of any information asset if the information contained within it is subject of an existing or pending investigation, subpoena, or audit. Destruction of this information to conceal it from investigation may be a criminal offense.


## Disposal of Electronic Media

Media used to store electronic data includes, but is not limited to:

*   Magnetic media (e.g. tapes, floppies, hard drives, etc.),
*   Optical media (CDs, DVDs and Blu-ray Disks),
*   Flash drives (thumb drives, SD Cards), and
*   Any other media that may be read by a computer.

Media that is to be reused within Welkin does not require special treatment. Media leaving Welkin's control must be overwritten with zeros before reuse.


## Disposal of Hard Copies

Hard copies may include paper, microfiche, photographs, or any other material in which information is stored and displayed. All Sensitive/Regulated, Restricted, or Confidential hard copy waste must be destroyed in such a manner that it is unreadable, such as shredding. A certified secure recycling vendor (e.g., Iron Mountain) may be used.


## Termination of Relationship

If the contract relationship between a customer and Welkin is terminated for any reason, Welkin retains the right to destroy that customer's data unless contractually obligated. Welkin must ensure this reservation of rights is preserved in contractual arrangements, to the extent permitted by law.
